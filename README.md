# Schrodinger's Planes &Psi;

### Welcome To Project Schrodinger's Planes! We present you a game where you exist in a small box (here, plane) which is a spoof on the Schrodinger's Cat thought experiment in a Multiverse. The story is as follows :-

You are put in a box which is about to be experimented on Schrodinger's thought experiment. It is known that the probability of your existence at the end of the experiment is 1/n. This of course happens in a multiverse, so there exist multiple universe with same circumstances! When The box closes, you realize that all the multiverses are connected and once your box is closed, you have the ability to travel to different universes! But that isn't it. You still can vanish if you aren't careful. Your task is to eat the life pill before time ends.

Beware! Different universe means different physical laws! In some planes time flows backwards, while in some it isn't a dimension at all. Different worlds have different obstacles and you cross them by switching your planes as required ( Now you realize the reason behind tunneling :) ). As you proceed to different levels, you realize that it gets even more weird.

```
Key Features:-
Reverse Time Flow
Quantum Tunneling
Travel to the realm of Multiverse
Schrodinger's Cat - like experiment!
```

#### Level 1

In level 1, you are put in a box at t = 0. The box is closed at t = 10, till when you get to explore your home plane. You get to know where the life pill is ( which is, fortunately, same for all planes ). Now, after t = 10, your parallel universe selves connect. You get access to all 3 (including home) universe and you task is to get a life pill before box is opened. Time flows forward in your universe, backward in second universe and doesn't exist in third. The connection gets cut when t touches 40, and box opens at t = 50 (for universe 1) or t = 0 (for universe 2). In universe 2 the connection gets cut at t = 10. Reach for your life pill on time or else you become the victim of multiverse's laws. You get to play thrice :busts_in_silhouette: (i.e. for three planes = three lives!). Discover other rules as this is what physics is all about.

#### Level 2
To be continued ...

### Notes :
* We intend to develop multiple levels and weirder laws for the game.
* The Project will then be built in Unity and a 3D  version of this game will be released (if this project succeeds).
* You might as well go through the code and make appropriate changes or develop a new level. Decent requests shall be pulled.
